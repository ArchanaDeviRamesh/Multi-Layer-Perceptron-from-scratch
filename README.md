* The given neural network is built using 1 hidden layer with 6 neurons and final layer contains 3 neurons for the 3 class labels
* The code is implemented from scratch using basic python libraries like numpy and pandas and sklearn for preprocessing
* A class is built for initializing parameters, defining sigmoid, softmax, forward propagation, backward propagation and cross entropy loss
